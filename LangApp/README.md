This is a stand-alone WebApp.

Its purpose is to learn English words from own texts (web links chosen by the user, txt or pdf texts). A user can load a text, choose unknown words, get them translated with LLM and later repeat them and translate sentences with these words generated by LLM.

Front end is running on a python library taipy. Additionally, there's some Java code in extensions library (my knowledge of Java/TypeScript is extremely limited, most of this code I generated with ChatGPT).

The main code seats in src directory.
